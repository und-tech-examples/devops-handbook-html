 <p class="body">Our goal is to enable market-oriented outcomes where many small teams can quickly and independently deliver value to the customer. This can be a challenge to achieve when Operations is centralized and functionally-oriented, having to serve the needs of many different development teams with potentially wildly different needs. The result can often be long lead times for needed Ops work, constant reprioritization and escalation, and poor deployment outcomes. </p>
 <p class="body">We can create more market-oriented outcomes by better integrating Ops capabilities into Dev teams, making both more efficient and productive. In this chapter, we’ll explore many ways to achieve this, both at the organizational level and through daily rituals. By doing this, Ops can significantly improve the productivity of Dev teams throughout the entire organization, as well as enable better collaboration and organizational outcomes. </p>
 <p class="body" id="ch8-1">At Big Fish Games, which develops and supports hundreds of mobile and thousands of PC games and had more than $266 million in revenue in 2013, VP of IT Operations Paul Farrall was in charge of the centralized Operations organization. He was responsible for supporting many different business units that had a great deal of autonomy. </p>
 <p class="body">Each of these business units had dedicated development teams who often chose wildly different technologies. When these groups wanted to deploy new functionality, they would have to compete for a common pool of scarce Ops resources. Furthermore, everyone was struggling with unreliable Test and Integration environments, as well as extremely cumbersome release processes. </p>
 <p class="body" data-ep_ppid="Page-__-133" id="Page-__-133"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg96" title="96"></span>Farrall thought the best way to solve this problem was by embedding Ops expertise into Development teams. <span id="ch8-2"></span>He observed, “When Dev teams had problems with testing or deployment, they needed more than just technology or environments. What they also needed was help and coaching. At first, we embedded Ops engineers and architects into each of the Dev teams, but there simply weren’t enough Ops engineers to cover that many teams. We were able to help more teams with what we called an <i class="calibre5">Ops liaison</i> model and with fewer people.” </p>
 <p class="body" id="ch8-3">Farrall defined two types of Ops liaisons: the business relationship manager and the dedicated release engineer. The business relationship managers worked with product management, line-of-business owners, project management, Dev management, and developers. They became intimately familiar with product group business drivers and product road maps, acted as advocates for product owners inside of Operations, and helped their product teams navigate the Operations landscape to prioritize and streamline work requests. </p>
 <p class="body">Similarly, the dedicated release engineer became intimately familiar with the product’s Development and QA issues, and helped them get what they needed from the Ops organization to achieve their goals. They were familiar with the typical Dev and QA requests for Ops, and would often execute the needed work themselves. As needed, they would also pull in dedicated technical Ops engineers (e.g., DBAs, Infosec, storage engineers, network engineers), and help determine which self-service tools the entire Operations group should prioritize building. </p>
 <p class="body">By doing this, Farrall was able to help Dev teams across the organization become more productive and achieve their team goals. Furthermore, he helped the teams prioritize around his global Ops constraints, reducing the number of surprises discovered mid-project and ultimately increasing the overall project throughput. </p>
 <p class="body">Farrall notes that both working relationships with Operations and code release velocity were noticeably improved as a result of the changes. <span id="ch8-4"></span>He concludes, “The Ops liaison model allowed us to embed IT Operations expertise into the Dev and Product teams without adding new headcount.” </p>
 <p class="body">The DevOps transformation at Big Fish Games shows how a centralized Operations team was able to achieve the outcomes typically associated with market-oriented teams. We can employ the three following broad strategies: </p>
 <ul data-ep_ppid="Page-__-134" id="Page-__-134" class="calibre12"> <li class="bullets"><span class="black"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg97" title="97"></span>Create self-service capabilities to enable developers in the service teams to be productive.</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">Embed Ops engineers into the service teams.</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">Assign Ops liaisons to the service teams when embedding Ops is not possible. </span></li>
 </ul>
 <p class="body">Lastly, we describe how Ops engineers can integrate into the Dev team rituals used in their daily work, including daily standups, planning, and retrospectives. </p>
 <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_65" class="calibre7">CREATE SHARED SERVICES TO INCREASE DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY </h2>
 <p class="body">One way to enable market-oriented outcomes is for Operations to create a set of centralized platforms and tooling services that any Dev team can use to become more productive, such as getting production-like environments, deployment pipelines, automated testing tools, production telemetry dashboards, and so forth.<sup class="footnotes"><span id="footnote-040-backlink" class="calibre9"><a class="_idfootnotelink" epub:type="noteref" href="../Text/DOHB-ch_08.html#footnote-040">†</a></span></sup> By doing this, we enable Dev teams to spend more time building functionality for their customer, as opposed to obtaining all the infrastructure required to deliver and support that feature in production. </p>
 <p class="body">All the platforms and services we provide should (ideally) be automated and available on demand, without requiring a developer to open up a ticket and wait for someone to manually perform work. This ensures that Operations doesn’t become a bottleneck for their customers (e.g., “We received your work request, and it will take six weeks to manually configure those test environments.”).<sup class="footnotes"><span id="footnote-039-backlink" class="calibre9"><a class="_idfootnotelink" epub:type="noteref" href="../Text/DOHB-ch_08.html#footnote-039">‡</a></span></sup> </p>
 <p class="body">By doing this, we enable the product teams to get what they need, when they need it, as well as reduce the need for communications and coordination. <span id="ch8-6"></span>As Damon Edwards observed, “Without these self-service Operations platforms, the cloud is just Expensive Hosting 2.0.” </p>
 <p class="body">In almost all cases, we will not mandate that internal teams use these platforms and services—these platform teams will have to win over and satisfy their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg98" title="98"></span>internal customers, sometimes even competing with external vendors. By creating this effective internal marketplace of capabilities, we help ensure that the platforms and services we create are the easiest and most appealing choice available (the path of least resistance). </p>
 <p class="body" data-ep_ppid="Page-__-135" id="Page-__-135">For instance, we may create a platform that provides a shared version control repository with pre-blessed security libraries, a deployment pipeline that automatically runs code quality and security scanning tools, which deploys our applications into <i class="calibre5">known, good environments</i> that already have production monitoring tools installed on them. Ideally, we make life so much easier for Dev teams that they will overwhelmingly decide that using our platform is the easiest, safest, and most secure means to get their applications into production. </p>
 <p class="body">We build into these platforms the cumulative and collective experience of everyone in the organization, including QA, Operations, and Infosec, which helps to create an ever safer system of work. This increases developer productivity and makes it easy for product teams to leverage common processes, such as performing automated testing and satisfying security and compliance requirements. </p>
 <p class="body">Creating and maintaining these platforms and tools is real product development—the customers of our platform aren’t our external customer but our internal Dev teams. Like creating any great product, creating great platforms that everyone loves doesn’t happen by accident. An internal platform team with poor customer focus will likely create tools that everyone will hate and quickly abandon for other alternatives, whether for another internal platform team or an external vendor. </p>
 <p class="body" id="ch8-7">Dianne Marsh, Director of Engineering Tools at Netflix, states that her team’s charter is to “support our engineering teams’ innovation and velocity. We don’t build, bake, or deploy anything for these teams, nor do we manage their configurations. Instead, we build tools to enable self-service. It’s okay for people to be dependent on our tools, but it’s important that they don’t become dependent on us.” </p>
 <p class="body">Often, these platform teams provide other services to help their customers learn their technology, migrate off of other technologies, and even provide coaching and consulting to help elevate the state of the practice inside the organization. These shared services also facilitate standardization, which enable engineers to quickly become productive, even if they switch between teams. For instance, if every product team chooses a different toolchain, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg99" title="99"></span>engineers may have to learn an entirely new set of technologies to do their work, putting the team goals ahead of the global goals. </p>
 <p class="body">In organizations where teams can only use approved tools, we can start by removing this requirement for a few teams, such as the transformation team, so that we can experiment and discover what capabilities make those teams more productive. </p>
 <p class="body" data-ep_ppid="Page-__-136" id="Page-__-136">Internal shared services teams should continually look for internal toolchains that are widely being adopted in the organization, deciding which ones make sense to be supported centrally and made available to everyone. In general, taking something that’s already working somewhere and expanding its usage is far more likely to succeed than building these capabilities from scratch.<sup class="footnotes"><span id="footnote-038-backlink" class="calibre9"><a class="_idfootnotelink" epub:type="noteref" href="../Text/DOHB-ch_08.html#footnote-038">§</a></span></sup> </p>
 <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_66" class="calibre7">EMBED OPS ENGINEERS INTO OUR SERVICE TEAMS </h2>
 <p class="body">Another way we can enable more market-oriented outcomes is by enabling product teams to become more self-sufficient by embedding Operations engineers within them, thus reducing their reliance on centralized Operations. These product teams may also be completely responsible for service delivery and service support. </p>
 <p class="body">By embedding Operations engineers into the Dev teams, their priorities are driven almost entirely by the goals of the product teams they are embedded in—as opposed to Ops focusing inwardly on solving their own problems. As a result, Ops engineers become more closely connected to their internal and external customers. Furthermore, the product teams often have the budget to fund the hiring of these Ops engineers, although interviewing and hiring decisions will likely still be done from the centralized Operations group, to ensure consistency and quality of staff. </p>
 <p class="body" id="ch8-8">Jason Cox said, “In many parts of Disney we have embedded Ops (system engineers) inside the product teams in our business units, along with inside Development, Test, and even Information Security. It has totally changed the dynamics of how we work. As Operations Engineers, we create the tools and capabilities that transform the way people work, and even the way they think. In traditional Ops, we merely drove the train that someone else built. But in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg100" title="100"></span>modern Operations Engineering, we not only help build the train, but also the bridges that the trains roll on.” </p>
 <p class="body">For new large Development projects, we may initially embed Ops engineers into those teams. Their work may include helping decide what to build and how to build it, influencing the product architecture, helping influence internal and external technology choices, helping create new capabilities in our internal platforms, and maybe even generating new operational capabilities. After the product is released to production, embedded Ops engineers may help with the production responsibilities of the Dev team. </p>
 <p class="body" data-ep_ppid="Page-__-137" id="Page-__-137">They will take part in all of the Dev team rituals, such as planning meetings, daily standups, and demonstrations where the team shows off new features and decides which ones to ship. As the need for Ops knowledge and capabilities decreases, Ops engineers may transition to different projects or engagements, following the general pattern that the composition within product teams changes throughout its life cycle. </p>
 <p class="body">This paradigm has another important advantage: pairing Dev and Ops engineers together is an extremely efficient way to cross-train operations knowledge and expertise into a service team. It can also have the powerful benefit of transforming operations knowledge into automated code that can be far more reliable and widely reused. </p>
 <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_67" class="calibre7">ASSIGN AN OPS LIAISON TO EACH SERVICE TEAM </h2>
 <p class="body">For a variety of reasons, such as cost and scarcity, we may be unable to embed Ops engineers into every product team. However, we can get many of the same benefits by assigning a designated liaison for each product team. </p>
 <p class="body" id="ch8-9">At Etsy, this model is called “designated Ops.” Their centralized Operations group continues to manage all the environments—not just production environments but also pre-production environments—to help ensure they remain consistent. The designated Ops engineer is responsible for understanding: </p>
 <ul class="calibre12"> <li class="bullets"><span class="black">What the new product functionality is and why we’re building it</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">How it works as it pertains to operability, scalability, and observability (diagramming is strongly encouraged)</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">How to monitor and collect metrics to ensure the progress, success, or failure of the functionality</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg101" title="101"></span>Any departures from previous architectures and patterns, and the justifications for them</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">Any extra needs for infrastructure and how usage will affect infrastructure capacity</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">Feature launch plans</span> </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="body" data-ep_ppid="Page-__-138" id="Page-__-138">Furthermore, just like in the embedded Ops model, this liaison attends the team standups, integrating their needs into the Operations road map and performing any needed tasks. We rely on these liaisons to escalate any resource contention or prioritization issue. By doing this, we identify any resource or time conflicts that should be evaluated and prioritized in the context of wider organizational goals. </p>
 <p class="body">Assigning Ops liaisons allows us to support more product teams than the embedded Ops model. Our goal is to ensure that Ops is not a constraint for the product teams. If we find that Ops liaisons are stretched too thin, preventing the product teams from achieving their goals, then we will likely need to either reduce the number of teams each liaison supports or temporarily embed an Ops engineer into specific teams. </p>
 <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_68" class="calibre7">INTEGRATE OPS INTO DEV RITUALS </h2>
 <p class="body">When Ops engineers are embedded or assigned as liaisons into our product teams, we can integrate them into our Dev team rituals. In this section, our goal is to help Ops engineers and other non-developers better understand the existing Development culture and proactively integrate them into all aspects of planning and daily work. As a result, Operations is better able to plan and radiate any needed knowledge into the product teams, influencing work long before it gets into production. The following sections describe some of the standard rituals used by Development teams using agile methods and how we would integrate Ops engineers into them. By no means are agile practices a prerequisite for this step—as Ops engineers, our goal is to discover what rituals the product teams follow, integrate into them, and add value to them.<sup class="footnotes"><span id="footnote-037-backlink" class="calibre9"><a class="_idfootnotelink" epub:type="noteref" href="../Text/DOHB-ch_08.html#footnote-037">¶</a></span></sup> </p>
 <p class="body" id="ch8-10"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg102" title="102"></span>As Ernest Mueller observed, “I believe DevOps works a lot better if Operations teams adopt the same agile rituals that Dev teams have used—we’ve had fantastic successes solving many problems associated with Ops pain points, as well as integrating better with Dev teams.” </p>
 <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_69" class="calibre11">INVITE OPS TO OUR DEV STANDUPS </h3>
 <p class="body">One of the Dev rituals popularized by Scrum is the daily standup, a quick meeting where everyone on the team gets together and presents to each other three things: what was done yesterday, what is going to be done today, and what is preventing you from getting your work done.<sup class="footnotes"><span id="footnote-036-backlink" class="calibre9"><a class="_idfootnotelink" epub:type="noteref" href="../Text/DOHB-ch_08.html#footnote-036">**</a></span></sup> </p>
 <p class="body" data-ep_ppid="Page-__-139" id="Page-__-139">The purpose of this ceremony is to radiate information throughout the team and to understand the work that is being done and is going to be done. By having team members present this information to each other, we learn about any tasks that are experiencing roadblocks and discover ways to help each other move our work toward completion. Furthermore, by having managers present, we can quickly resolve prioritization and resource conflicts. </p>
 <p class="body">A common problem is that this information is compartmentalized within the Development team. By having Ops engineers attend, Operations can gain an awareness of the Development team’s activities, enabling better planning and preparation—for instance, if we discover that the product team is planning a big feature rollout in two weeks, we can ensure that the right people and resources are available to support the rollout. Alternatively, we may highlight areas where closer interaction or more preparation is needed (e.g., creating more monitoring checks or automation scripts). By doing this, we create the conditions where Operations can help solve our current team problems (e.g., improving performance by tuning the database, instead of optimizing code) or future problems before they turn into a crisis (e.g., creating more integration test environments to enable performance testing). </p>
 <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_70" class="calibre11">INVITE OPS TO OUR DEV RETROSPECTIVES </h3>
 <p class="body">Another widespread agile ritual is the retrospective. At the end of each development interval, the team discusses what was successful, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the successes and improvements in future iterations or projects. The team comes up with ideas to make things better <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg103" title="103"></span>and reviews experiments from the previous iteration. This is one of the primary mechanisms where organizational learning and the development of countermeasures occurs, with resulting work implemented immediately or added to the team’s backlog. </p>
 <p class="body">Having Ops engineers attend our project team retrospectives means they can also benefit from any new learnings. Furthermore, when there is a deployment or release in that interval, Operations should present the outcomes and any resulting learnings, creating feedback into the product team. By doing this, we can improve how future work is planned and performed, improving our outcomes. Examples of feedback that Operations can bring to a retrospective include: </p>
 <ul data-ep_ppid="Page-__-140" id="Page-__-140" class="calibre12"> <li class="bullets"><span class="black">“Two weeks ago, we found a monitoring blind-spot and agreed on how to fix it. It worked. We had an incident last Tuesday, and we were able to quickly detect and correct it before any customers were impacted.”</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">“Last week’s deployment was one of the most difficult and lengthy we’ve had in over a year. Here are some ideas on how it can be improved.”</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">“The promotion campaign we did last week was far more difficult than we thought it would be, and we should probably not make an offer like that again. Here are some ideas on other offers we can make to achieve our goals.”</span> </li>
 <li class="bullets"><span class="black">“During the last deployment, the biggest problem we had was our firewall rules are now thousands of lines long, making it extremely difficult and risky to change. We need to re-architect how we prevent unauthorized network traffic.”</span> </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="body">Feedback from Operations helps our product teams better see and understand the downstream impact of decisions they make. When there are negative outcomes, we can make the changes necessary to prevent them in the future. Operations feedback will also likely identify more problems and defects that should be fixed—it may even uncover larger architectural issues that need to be addressed. </p>
 <p class="body">The additional work identified during project team retrospectives falls into the broad category of improvement work, such as fixing defects, refactoring, and automating manual work. Product managers and project managers may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg104" title="104"></span>want to defer or deprioritize improvement work in favor of customer features. </p>
 <p class="body">However, we must remind everyone that improvement of daily work is more important than daily work itself, and that all teams must have dedicated capacity for this (e.g., reserving 20% of all cycles for improvement work, scheduling one day per week or one week per month, etc.). Without doing this, the productivity of the team will almost certainly grind to a halt under the weight of its own technical and process debt. </p>
 <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_71" class="calibre11">MAKE RELEVANT OPS WORK VISIBLE ON SHARED KANBAN BOARDS </h3>
 <p class="body">Often, Development teams will make their work visible on a project board or kanban board. It’s far less common, however, for work boards to show the relevant Operations work that must be performed in order for the application to run successfully in production, where customer value is actually created. As a result, we are not aware of necessary Operations work until it becomes an urgent crisis, jeopardizing deadlines or creating a production outage. </p>
 <p class="body" data-ep_ppid="Page-__-141" id="Page-__-141">Because Operations is part of the product value stream, we should put the Operations work that is relevant to product delivery on the shared kanban board. This enables us to more clearly see all the work required to move our code into production, as well as keep track of all Operations work required to support the product. Furthermore, it enables us to see where Ops work is blocked and where work needs escalation, highlighting areas where we may need improvement. </p>
 <p class="body">Kanban boards are an ideal tool to create visibility, and visibility is a key component in properly recognizing and integrating Ops work into all the relevant value streams. When we do this well, we achieve market-oriented outcomes, regardless of how we’ve drawn our organization charts. </p>
 <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_72" class="calibre7"><a id="_IDTEXTANCHOR008" class="_idfootnotelink"></a>CONCLUSION </h2>
 <p class="body">Throughout this chapter, we explored ways to integrate Operations into the daily work of Development, and looked at how to make our work more visible to Operations. To accomplish this, we explored three broad strategies, including creating self-service capabilities to enable developers in service teams to be productive, embedding Ops engineers into the service teams, and assigning Ops liaisons to the service teams when embedding Ops engineers was not possible. Lastly, we described how Ops engineers can integrate with the Dev <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg105" title="105"></span>team through inclusion in their daily work, including daily standups, planning, and retrospectives. </p>
 <div class="pagebreak"></div><h2 id="sigil_toc_id_73" class="calibre7">PART II CONCLUSION </h2>
 <p class="body">In Part II: <i class="calibre5">Where to Start</i>, we explored a variety of ways to think about DevOps transformations, including how to choose where to start, relevant aspects of architecture and organizational design, and how to organize our teams. We also explored how to integrate Ops into all aspects of Dev planning and daily work. </p>
 <p class="body">In Part III: The First Way,<i class="calibre5"> The Technical Practices of Flow</i>, we will now start to explore how to implement the specific technical practices to realize the principles of flow, which enable the fast flow of work from Development to Operations without causing chaos and disruption downstream. </p>
